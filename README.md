# Analysis of comedy sitcom script

My team and I used scripts from the beloved sitcom, Friends, and attempted to find topics that are prevalent in the show to identify themes that makes the show successful.
While our analysis wasn't too conclusive, I noticed that there were some other things we could do to refine our analysis.

The ultimate goal was to create a bot that could generate content that incorporate these themes as a starting for aspiring script writers.

This is our my very first iterations and approach to this topic, but I will attempt to refine and incorporate text generation/summarisation in the future.
